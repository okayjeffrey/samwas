Designing for other artists is a hard thing, because we are all critics. After seeing Stephenâ€™s work and becoming friends with him, I saw we were very much on the same page, so creating a identity, business cards, and gallery site was the task! His favorite photos through out his work were ones of birds over water, which was an amazing visual that I wanted to capture for him. Integrating the C from his last name would further the relationship of the mark.
