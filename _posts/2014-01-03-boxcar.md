Since moving to Colorado I’ve become somewhat of a coffee nerd, and in effect becoming good friends with a lot of people in the coffee industry. It’s always a good thing being friends with your drug dealer! I oddly did not meet Vaj & Cara at Boxcar through coffee though, but was glad to be able help them out with what they needed.

They love coffee and love the craft of it. Vaj with a background of making handmade dutch inspired furniture, spoke a lot about what they were setting forth in doing. As well as the quality they expected as a client, which was very exciting. They were looking for a identity that would be timeless, and spoke to the craft/trade to show the hand made quality.
